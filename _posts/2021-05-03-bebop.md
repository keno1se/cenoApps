excerpt: Melodic minor to Harmonica scaler app
---

The melodic minor scale is very useful. It fits major, minor and dominant chords. 
Easy to build but as always takes time to transpose to other keys; Harmonica scaler app comes handy for that. 

Start from the major scale then lower the third scale degree one semitone. 

C, D, **E**, F, G, A, B : C-major scale  
C, D, **Eb**, F, G, A, B : C-melodic minor scale
