<h2 id="aboutHS">About Harmonica scaler</h2>  

HarmonicaScaler will display on Richter tuned diatonic harmonicas:  
- Layout of 12 different keys  
- All 12 positions  
- Common scales on top



The diatonic Richter tuned harmonica is truly a mighty little instrument. It can produce the full chromatic scale over three octaves for some scales. This humble piece fits in your pocket.  

To learn a certain scale may not be that difficult but then to transpose it to another key  
can be a bit of a struggle; every individual tone to a new value; then find those on the  
harmonica; web search; paper and pen and lost notes…  

HarmonicaScaler is powerful and makes the process easier and it’s very visual as well.

The chromatic scale consists of 12 tones: C, C♯, D, E♭, E, F, F♯, G, A♭, A, B♭, B

Scales over one harmonica
Even though the diatonic harmonica is designed to play in a single key; all the twelve chromatic tones can be played; and can be used to build scales up on. In other words: One scale can be played in 12 different keys on        One tone
        One tone in selected: "C". Scales are displayed for that tone.one harmonica. HarmonicaScaler works with 10 different scales. So over twelve keys the possible number of scales that can be displayed are:
10 scales x 12 keys = **120 scales**

Scales over twelve harmonicas
For every tone in the chromatic scale it exists a harmonica in that key. So over twelve harmonicas the possible number of scales that can be displayed are:
10 scales x 12 keys x 12 harmonicas = **1440 scales**
